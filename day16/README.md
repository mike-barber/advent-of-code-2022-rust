I'm not completely happy with this solution yet. It does solve the problem, but it takes about 4.5 minutes to do so. The algorithm could definitely be improved, perhaps with a node-to-node distance matrix estimate the max possible payoff for a given choice. Currently I'm just using the value of each node and the time remaining, but not taking into account the cost to get to each node from the current location.
