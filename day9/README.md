You just need to work out where the tail goes as the head follows a series of motions. 
- Assume the head and the tail both start at the same position, overlapping.
- horizontal or vertical - tail moves in that direction
- distance is diagonal - tail moves diagonally (not vertical or horiz.)
- count up all of the positions the tail visited at least once

For example:

```
R 4
U 4
L 3
D 1
R 4
D 1
L 5
R 2
```
